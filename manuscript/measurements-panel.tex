\section{}

Seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated regularly to account for mutations that allow influenza viruses to escape our existing immunity.
A successful vaccine should represent the genetic diversity of recently circulating viruses and induce antibodies that effectively prevent infection by those recent viruses.
Thus, linking the genetic composition of circulating viruses and the serological experimental results measuring antibody efficacy is crucial to the vaccine design decision.
Historically, genetic and serological data have been presented separately in the form of static visualizations of phylogenetic trees and tabular serological results to identify vaccine candidates.
To simplify this decision-making process, we have created an interactive tool for visualizing serological data that has been integrated into Nextstrain’s real-time phylogenetic visualization framework, Auspice.
We show how the combined interactive visualizations may be used by decision-makers to explore the relationships between complex data sets for both prospective vaccine strain selection and retrospectively exploring the performance of vaccine strains.

\section{Introduction}

Seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses primarily evolve by acquiring mutations that allow them to escape antibodies from previous infections or vaccinations \citep{Petrova2018}.
This process, known as antigenic drift, changes the appearance of viral surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.
Hemagglutinin (HA) is the primary target of our adaptive immunity and the primary component of the seasonal influenza vaccine.
Therefore, continued antigenic drift in HA necessitates regular updates to the seasonal influenza vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) collects HA genome sequences and performs serological experiments to track antigenic drift throughout the year \citep{Morris:2017ea}.
HA genome sequences reveal ``clades'' or groups of recent influenza viruses that descend from a common ancestor and share the same mutations that may contribute to antigenic drift.
Serological experiments measure antigenic drift by quantifying how well viruses from different clades can escape detection by antibodies against vaccine candidates.

The gold standard of these serological experiments is the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay \citep{hirst1943studies}.
HI assays measure the minimum concentration or ``titer'' of antibodies required to prevent a given test virus from binding to red blood cells.
Typically, antibodies come from previously uninfected ferrets who are then infected with a specific reference virus (e.g., a vaccine candidate).
Each HI assay requires a series of two-fold dilutions of ferret antibodies to determine the minimum titer that inhibits binding.
The higher the antibody titer required to prevent binding, the more antigenically drifted the test virus is from the reference virus.
To enable comparison between measurements from different reference viruses, researchers normalize titers by the titer required to inhibit the reference virus itself and convert values to a $\log_{2}$ scale \citep{Neher:2016hy}.
The resulting values represent the magnitude of antigenic distance between a given reference virus and other test viruses.
Traditionally, viruses with an antigenic distance greater than $2\log_{2}$ units are considered antigenically distinct \citep{Katz2011}.

To understand long-term patterns of antigenic drift, researchers have summarized these pairwise antigenic distances with statistical or visual representations.
For example, antigenic cartography places high-dimensional antigenic distances in a two-dimensional space using multidimensional scaling \citep{Smith:2004jc,Bedford:2014bf}.
These map-like visualizations reveal long-term trends in antigenic drift within seasonal influenza lineages like the punctuated emergence of new antigenic clusters every few years.
However, antigenic cartography is less suited to representations of short-term antigenic drift on the same time scale as annual vaccine updates in each hemisphere.

To understand short-term patterns of antigenic drift that would require an update to the vaccine, WHO decision makers need to answer specific questions.
These include a) which available vaccine candidates require additional titer measurements against currently circulating clades, b) which vaccine candidates have the lowest antigenic distance to each clade, and c) what is the antigenic diversity of recent clades.
In practice, decision makers must choose the next vaccine candidate from a small pool of viable options.
The best candidate will have titer measurements against all current clades and have the lowest antigenic distance across these clades.
Such candidates are said to effectively ``cover'' currently circulating clades.
Determining the vaccine candidate that most effectively covers recent clades requires a direct comparison of antigenic distances across all available vaccine candidates.

We have previously developed two alternate visualizations of antigenic data to answer these questions and inform vaccine selection through reports to the WHO \citep{BedfordWHO2018,BedfordWHO2019}.
The first visualization is an interactive phylogenetic view implemented in the genomic epidemiology tool \emph{nextflu} \citep{NeherBedford2015,NeherBedford2018}.
When the user selects a given reference virus from the phylogeny (by selecting a ``gear'' icon), the tool plots the pairwise antigenic distances between that reference and the corresponding test viruses in the tree using color to represent the distance values (Figure~\ref{fig:1}A).
This representation reveals clades that the selected reference virus may or may not cover and which clades lack measurements against the reference.
While this view provides phylogenetic context of titer measurements and shows the individual pairwise measurements, it does not support direct comparison of antigenic distances from different vaccine candidates.
Instead, users must quickly toggle between different vaccine candidates in the tree to get a sense of how well different viruses may perform.

To complement the interactive phylogenetic visualization, we also developed a static heatmap visualization that summarizes the mean antigenic distances between a subset of vaccine candidates and all tests viruses within each extant clade.
The resulting heatmaps use the x-axis to encode the names of major clades, the y-axis to encode the names of reference viruses, and color and text to encode the mean $\log_{2}$ distance between a given reference virus and corresponding test viruses in each clade (Figure~\ref{fig:1}B).
These heatmaps allow decision makers to directly compare average antigenic distances for different vaccine candidates and quantify how these candidates cover extant clades.
However, these heatmaps suffer reduced expressiveness by encoding the most valuable quantitative data with color instead of a spatial scale.
Additionally, this view shows a summary statistic instead of the underlying distributions of the data, concealing the number and variance of measurements for each reference virus.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Visual design}

To overcome the limitations of existing antigenic visualizations, we applied user-driven design based on the goals of decision makers described above and used standard visual design principles to produce a more expressive and effective visualization for influenza virologists.
Of the two previous visualizations we developed, the static heatmaps addressed the most user goals except for communicating which extant clades were missing measurements.
Our two previous visualizations either obscured or hid the underlying distributions of the raw data.
Since visualization of these distributions can improve confidence during the decision making process \citep{correll2014error,Hullman2015,Fernandes2018}, we treated the need to view these distributions as an auxillary user goal.

In the context of visual design principles, both the phylogenetic and heatmap views encode the most relevant quantitative data of antigenic distance with color.
However, quantitative data can be more effectively represented by positional encodings (e.g., x- or y-axis positions) whereas nominal data (e.g., phylogenetic clades) can be effectively encoded with color \citep{Mackinlay1986}.
In the phylogenetic view, the two available positional axes represent time and the unitless phylogenetic position of nodes, neither of which are relevant to the user goals described above.
In the heatmaps, the two positional axes encode two nominal data types.

We reasoned that we could make a more effective visualization that addressed all user goals by simply changing the encoding of data in the heatmaps.
To this end, we swapped the encoding of antigenic distances and test clades, encoding quantitative distances on the x-axis positional scale and encoding nominal test clades with a color scale.
The positional encoding of antigenic distances allowed us to visually encode relevant thresholds for decision making (i.e., $x = 2\log_{2}$), show all available measurements for each reference virus at once, and display a summary statistic (mean and standard deviation of antigenic distances) for each reference virus.
We retained the encoding of nominal reference virus names on the y-axis, since most user goals require comparison of distances between specific vaccine candidates.

\subsection{Implementation}

We implemented this design as a new interactive measurements panel within Nextstrain's visualization tool, Auspice, which is freely available on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice}) under the AGPLv3 license.
This implementation maintains the phylogenetic context and interactive data exploration provided by the \emph{nextflu} implementation.
The visualization requires a minimum of two JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files that are produced by the Nextstrain bioinformatics toolkit, Augur \citep{Huddleston2021}.
The phylogenetic tree is provided via a dataset JSON file produced by \texttt{augur export v2} and the measurements data is provided via a measurements sidecar JSON file produced by \texttt{augur measurements}.
The measurements file must follow a specific filename format for Auspice to link it to the dataset file, where the dataset filename is \texttt{\$\{name\}.json} and the measurements filename must be \texttt{\$\{name\}\_measurements.json}.
The application can be cloned and run locally or users can use Auspice through two public websites.
Users can drag and drop dataset and measurements files onto \url{https://auspice.us/} to visualize the data locally in their own browser.
Visualizations can be also shared with others through \url{https://nextstrain.org/}.
Full documentation for sharing analyses through Nextstrain can be found at \url{https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/index.html}.

\subsection{Data curation and analysis}

We evaluated the new measurements panel by constructing a Nextstrain analysis \citep{Hadfield2018} with previously published HA genomes and HI titers \citep{Bedford:2014bf}.
A full data curation guide is available online at \url{https://github.com/blab/measurements-panel/tree/main/data#readme} and a full guide to running the bioinformatics analyses is available at \url{https://github.com/blab/measurements-panel#readme}.
Briefly, we downloaded HI titer data and accessions for H3N2 HA sequences from \cite{Bedford:2014bf}'s GitHub repository.
We downloaded and combined HA sequences from the Influenza Virus Resource or GISAID, depending on the original source.
We parsed metadata including viral strain name, database accession, and collection date from the sequence headers with \texttt{augur parse}.
We constructed an annotated phylogenetic tree and measurements panel with Augur commands as part of a workflow implemented with Snakemake \citep{Molder2021}.
To construct the measurements panel JSON, we normalized the raw HI titer measurements with Augur's implementation of the titer substitution model \citep{Neher:2016hy}, converted these measurements to a tab-separated values (TSV) file with a custom Python script, and ran the new \texttt{augur measurements export} command with this TSV file as input.
The resulting visualization for this paper has been shared via Nextstrain community and can be viewed at \url{https://nextstrain.org/community/blab/measurements-panel/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Interactive visualization of titer measurements}

Our goal for incorporating the measurements panel into Auspice is to allow users to explore relationships between the genetic and serological data in one interactive visualization.
Test viruses of the titer data are directly linked by name to the viruses displayed in the phylogenetic tree, to ensure that any interactions with the tree also affect the measurements displayed.
When users filter the tree by date (Figure~\ref{fig:2}a), metadata attributes of viruses (Figure~\ref{fig:2}d), or subtrees selected by clicking on a corresponding tree branch, the measurements panel updates to reflect only the matching test viruses.
Users can easily focus on a subset of phylogenetically relevant measurements and examine the measurements of test viruses in recently circulating clades.
The measurements are colored by the same coloring attribute (Figure~\ref{fig:2}b) as the phylogenetic tree, adding the legend values (Figure~\ref{fig:2}c) as another dimension of nominal data to the titer measurements.
This coloring is especially useful for viewing titer data by genotypes of test viruses, allowing users to inspect relationships between specific mutations in HA and antigenic drift quantified by titer measurements.

The measurements JSON can include multiple collections of titers for a single phylogenetic tree and users can change the collection displayed with the collection dropdown (Figure~\ref{fig:2}e).
Users can then review different sets of data for the same phylogenetic tree such as separate measurements of cell- and egg-passaged virus titers.
Within each collection, users can compare measurements across different groupings by changing the grouping category with the ``group by'' dropdown (Figure~\ref{fig:2}f).
For vaccine selection, grouping by the reference strain (Figure~\ref{fig:2}j) allows decision makers to directly compare titers across multiple vaccine candidates.
Other groupings such as data source or ferret serum can be used to explore the variability of the titer measurements.
The overall mean for each grouping can then be toggled (Figure~\ref{fig:2}h) for whole group comparisons.

The data display can be switched between mean with standard deviation and raw individual measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:2}g).
The means are calculated per color attribute to allow for comparisons across attributes within each group.
This view maintains the ability to view the mean antigenic distance for test viruses within each clade that we had implemented in the static heat maps.
The raw measurements view plots each individual measurement to give users a detailed view of the quantity and distribution of titers, which can inform design decisions for future titer experiments.
The titers threshold can be toggled (Figure~\ref{fig:2}i) to add a clear demarcation of the threshold value for a binary view of when titer measurements are considered antigenically distinct (Figure~\ref{fig:2}k).
We discuss the application of these features in detail in two case studies in the following sections.

\subsection{Case study 1: Retrospective vaccine strain selection in fall 2009}

The WHO convenes influenza vaccine composition meetings (VCMs) twice per year with each meeting occurring approximately 9 months prior to the next influenza season in a given hemisphere \citep{Morris:2017ea}.
The northern hemisphere VCM occurs in February or March ahead of a winter season in October through April.
The southern hemisphere VCM occurs in September or October ahead of a winter season in April through October.
To demonstrate the utility of an interactive visualization of serological measurements for vaccine composition decisions, we performed a retrospective analysis of a H3N2 vaccine update made for the southern hemisphere in the fall of 2009.
We used publicly available sequence and titer data \citep{Bedford:2014bf} to reconstruct a H3N2 HA phylogeny and measurements panel representing information that was available at the time of the VCM (see Methods).
We note that the actual selection process used a richer dataset which is not publicly available to include here, and as such these data should be seen as representative of the process only.

The VCM ahead of the 2010 southern hemisphere season occurred in September 2009.
Three clades circulated at that time including 173Q and two of its subclades named 144K and 158N/189K (Figure~\ref{fig:3}A).
The most recent H3N2 vaccine strain, A/Brisbane/10/2007, had been used for the two prior influenza seasons (2008 and 2009) and represented an older clade, 140I, that had since been replaced by 173Q \citep{WHO:archive}.
Prior to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 vaccine, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 had been the vaccine strain in the 2007 southern hemisphere season.
While 173Q dominated the 2008-2009 season, 144K appeared to be dominant in September 2009.
At the time of the VCM, titers for both A/Brisbane/10/2007 and A/Wisconsin/67/2005 against test viruses from 144K and 158N/189K exceeded the $2\log_{2}$ threshold (Figure~\ref{fig:3}B), indicating their inability to cover these recent clades.
In contrast, a newer vaccine candidate from the 144K clade, A/Perth/16/2009, had mean titers less than $1\log_{2}$ from the same recent clades.
These results strongly supported an update from the previous vaccine strain to a vaccine based on A/Perth/16/2009.
The WHO announced this decision on September 25, 2009.

Our retrospective analysis allows us to see how the evolution of H3N2 continued after the VCM decision.
Data collected after the vaccine selection deadline show that clade 158N/189K dominated for the following H3N2 seasons in both hemispheres (Figure~\ref{fig:3}A).
Although later HI measurements show that A/Perth/16/2009 did not cover viruses from 158N/189K as effectively as viruses from its own 144K clade (with mean $log_{2}$ values exceeding 1), the new vaccine was still a better antigenic match than the previous two vaccines (Figure~\ref{fig:3}C).
A/Perth/16/2009 remained the WHO's recommended H3N2 vaccine strain for the 2010-12 southern hemisphere seasons and the 2010-11 and 2011-12 northern hemisphere seasons \citep{WHO:recent}.

\subsection{Case study 2: Identification of genotype-specific patterns through visualization of raw data}

Influenza researchers often define clades of H3N2 viruses based on the presence of mutations that have been previously shown to enable viruses to escape existing immunity \citep{Wolf:2006da,Shih:2007bd,Koel:2013jz}.
The genetic similarity of viruses in the same clade typically corresponds with antigenic similarity of the same viruses as measured by HI assays.
However, new mutations may arise within a clade that cause test viruses with those mutations to differ antigenically from earlier viruses in the same clade.
Here, we demonstrate how aggregation of antigenic distances by clade can obscure the emergence of antigenically novel test viruses and how visualization of raw measurements can reveal these important patterns.

Using the same data from the previous case study, we noted that clade 144V circulated between 1984 and 1992 (Figure~\ref{fig:4}A) and that multiple HI measurements existed for reference and test viruses from this clade.
We identified two reference viruses in 144V with similar average HI measurements and divergent raw distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:4}B).
A/Shanghai/11/1987 had a mean antigenic distance of 1.64 $\pm$ 2.53 units, while A/Beijing/353/1989 had a mean distance of 1.13 $\pm$ 1.42 units.
The distributions of raw HI measurements reveal a bimodal distribution for A/Shanghai/11/1987 data and a unimodal distribution for A/Beijing/353/1989 (Figure~\ref{fig:4}C).
We hypothesized that antigenic mutations could explain the two clusters of test viruses in the A/Shanghai/11/1987 data.

Nextstrain's Auspice tool provides multiple approaches to interrogate the mutations observed within a clade such as 144V.
For example, the entropy panel quantifies the diversity of mutations present at each position in a given viral genome with higher values indicating more distinct amino acid mutations at a single position.
We observed that position HA1:135 had the highest entropy among the 144V HA genomes.
This position was previously identified as a putative antigenic site in HA where mutations could enable escape from existing immunity \citep{Wolf:2006da}.
Based on this genetic information, we colored the HI measurements by the genotypes of the test viruses at this position.
The genotype-specific coloring shows three different alleles at position 135 including the ancestral 135G and two derived alleles of 135E and 135D (Figure~\ref{fig:4}D).
This view also reveals that test viruses with same 135G genotype as A/Shanghai/11/1987 have lower antigenic distances (mean of -1.00 $\pm$ 1.34 units), while viruses with the derived 135E and 135D genotypes have higher antigenic distances (3.74 $\pm$ 0.69 and 2.73 $\pm$ 0.89, respectively).
Measurements against A/Beijing/353/1989 show the inverse pattern with lower distances from this reference to test viruses with 135E and 135D (0.46 $\pm$ 0.79 and 0.72 $\pm$ 0.71, respectively) and higher distances to 135G (3.05 $\pm$ 1.18).

These results demonstrate how summary statistics can obscure biologically relevant patterns in the raw data.
They also show how the ability to interactively color data by different viral attributes like genotype can produce hypotheses to explain the patterns we see in the raw data.
Importantly, these results do not confirm that the differences we observe in antigenic distances were caused by mutations at HA1:135.
The same test viruses with derived 135 mutations also have mutations at two positions adjacent to HA's receptor binding site, HA1:145 and 193, where mutations have been previously shown to cause antigenic drift \citep{Koel:2013jz}.
Confirmation of mutational effects requires further experimental work.
However, this interactive visualization tool enables decision makers to explore their data and generate new hypotheses in ways that previous tools did not.

    Previous approaches to static visualization of serological data for seasonal influenza vaccine composition reports.
A) Phylogenetic visualization \citep{NeherBedford2018} allows the user to select a single vaccine candidate (e.g., A/Stockholm/6/2014) and see how well that strain might protect against other circulating viruses in their genetic context based on the antigenic distance encoded by color (orange and red color indicate greater distance and less protection by the selected strain).
To compare multiple vaccine candidates, users have to select different reference viruses manually and toggle between them.
B) Heatmap visualization of mean antigenic distances between multiple vaccine candidates (reference viruses on the y-axis) and viruses in currently circulating phylogenetic clades.
Heatmaps encode distance by color and text, allowing the user to compare how well multiple vaccine candidates might protect against circulating viruses.
C) Interval plot of mean $\pm$ 89\% confidence interval values of antigenic distances between vaccine candidates (y-axis) and viruses in currently circulating clades.
Unlike the heatmap visualization, the interval plot encodes distance with a spatial scale (the x-axis) instead of color and encodes clades with color instead of the spatial scale.
The vertical gray lines represent the threshold above which strains are considered antigenically distinct (x=2, solid line) and where strains are antigenically identical (x=0, dashed line).
This view allows users to compare multiple vaccine candidates, identify the candidate that covers specific clades based on a mean value to the left of the threshold at x=2, and view the variance in the underlying HI measurements.
D) Combined swarm and interval plot showing the raw pairwise measurements between each vaccine candidate and the test viruses in each clade.
This view allows users to perform the same tasks as the interval plot, but it also allows users to identify how many measurements support the summary statistics for a given vaccine candidate and identify multiple modes in the raw data distribution that could indicate within-clade antigenic variation.

    C) Same as (B) but including test viruses and HI measurements collected after the VCM, which were mainly from clade 158N/189K.
    With mean HI titers less than $2\log_{2}$, A/Perth/16/2009 covered this successful clade better than the previous vaccines.

    Antigenic distances from HI assays between clade 144V reference and test viruses, highlighting two reference viruses with similar mean distances and divergent raw distributions.
    A) Summary phylogenetic tree with clade 144V highlighted in red.
    B) HI measurements when viewed as mean $\pm$ standard deviation show similar average values for two reference viruses and a wide range of antigenic diversity per reference.
    C) Viewing the individual measurements reveals a previously hidden bimodal distribution in the measurements for the A/Shanghai/11/1987 reference virus compared to an apparently unimodal distribution for the A/Beijing/353/1989 reference virus.
    D) Coloring individual measurements by genotypes as the putative antigenic site HA1:135 shows a potential genotype-specific explanation for the two clusters seen in the A/Shanghai/11/1987 measurements and a similar bimodal distribution in the measurements for A/Beijing/353/1989 that was not as clear when coloring by clade alone.
