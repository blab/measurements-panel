abstract={The evolution of seasonal influenza viruses is an important source of disease burden, as it allows for the reinfection of previously infected or vaccinated individualsGiven that 5--15{\%} of the global human population is infected with seasonal influenza viruses each year, it is surprising that new antigenic variants arise only every 3--5 years for A/H3N2 viruses and less frequently for A/H1N1 and B virusesThe virus surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin is the primary target of the host immune response, and evolutionary selection pressure drives it to acquire mutations to escape immune recognition without eliminating its receptor binding functionHost immunity has a dual role in governing the pace of virus evolution: innate immunity acts as a constraint on the generation of new virus variants, whereas adaptive immunity selects for immune escape mutantsThe acute nature of influenza virus infections and population-level epidemics provides limited opportunities for evolutionary selection, with most virus diversity being lost before selection can operateInfluenza virus vaccines can provide effective protection against infection when they are well matched to circulating viruses, but there remains scope for improving vaccine production and delivery to achieve better effectiveness},

All analyses are based on the nextflu pipeline with continual updates posted to http://nextflu.org. A/H3N2: H3N2 diversity has largely been replaced by subclades A1b, A2 and A3 within 3c2.A. Subclades A1b and A2 predominate in the population and each shows increases in frequency, mutations at epitope sites and evidence for minor changes to antigenic phenotype. Clade A1b may be marginally fitter than clade A2, but we expect both clades to persist into the future without a clear immediate winner. A/H1N1pdm: A clade comprising mutations S74R, S164T and I295V has recently swept to fixation. The rapidity of this sweep suggests a selective origin. However, there is no evidence of antigenic change. B/Vic: Very little B/Vic activity has been observed in recent months. A clade with a two codon deletion at sites HA1:162/163 has gradually risen in frequency. HI measurements suggest an 8 to 16-fold titer drop relative to the vaccine strain, but this antigenic change has not yet resulted in a rapid rise of this variant. B/Yam: Europe experienced a strong and early B/Yam season in absence of amino acid variation in HA or antigenic diversity. However, several mutations in NA have rapidly swept or risen to intermediate frequencies.},

This is not meant as a comprehensive report, but is instead intended as particular observations that we{\textquoteright}ve made that may be of relevance. Please also note that observed patterns reflect the GISAID database and may not be entirely representative of underlying dynamics. All analyses are based on the nextflu/nextstrain pipeline [1,2] with continual updates posted to nextstrain.org/flu. A/H3N2: A/H3N2 viruses continue to show substantial diversity in HA sequences with a deep split between 3c3.A and 3c2.A1b viruses. The most notable recent developments are the rapid rise of clade A1b/137F {\textendash} a subclade of A1b/135K {\textendash} in China and Bangladesh and clade A1b/197R {\textendash} a subclade of A1b/131K {\textendash} which dominates the ongoing season in Australia. Our models predict that A1b/137F and A1b/197R will be the dominant clades next year with A1b/197R accounting for most circulation. There is, however, large uncertainty in the true extent of A1b/137F circulation. A/H1N1pdm: The S183P substitution has risen to near fixation. The most successful subclade carrying this mutation is 183P-5 which has essentially replaced competing variants. A variant with substitutions 129D/185I is at 60\% prevalence globally, while a second variant with substitution 130N is at 50\% in North America and ~10\% elsewhere. Substitutions at site 156 to D or K have arisen sporadically and result in loss of recognition by antisera raised against viruses with asparagine at position 156. Despite the large antigenic effect, viruses with mutations at site 156 don{\textquoteright}t seem to spread. Beyond variants at site 156, little to no antigenic evolution is evident in assays with ferret antisera. B/Vic: Antigenically drifted deletion variants at HA1 sites 162, 163 and 164 are now dominating global circulation and have all but taken over. The double deletion variant V1A.1 had previously been circulating at high frequency in the Americas. However, over the course of 2009, the triple deletion variant V1A.3 has increased in frequency globally and is now dominating in all geographic regions. Importantly, V1A.1 and V1A.3 variants appear antigenically distinct by HI assays with 4-8 fold reductions in log2 titer in both directions. B/Yam: B/Yam has not circulated in large numbers since the Northern Hemisphere season 2017/2018 and displays relatively little amino acid variation in HA or antigenic diversity. Amino acid variants at sites 229 and 232 have begun to circulate and population is now split between 229D/232D, 229N/232D and 229D/232N variants. These variants show little sign of antigenic difference in HI assays.},

abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

In contrast to the statistical background required to interpret many static representations of distributions, HOPs require relatively little background knowledge to interpret. Instead, HOPs enables viewers to infer properties of the distribution using mental processes like counting and integration. We conducted an experiment comparing HOPs to error bars and violin plots. With HOPs, people made much more accurate judgments about plots of two and three quantities. Accuracy was similar with all three representations for most questions about distributions of a single quantity.},

Unfortunately, direct experimental characterization of new viral variants lags their sequence-based identification. Here we help address this challenge by aggregating deep mutational scanning data into an ‘escape estimator’ that estimates the antigenic effects of arbitrary combinations of mutations to the virus’s spike receptor-binding domain. The estimator can be used to intuitively visualize how mutations impact polyclonal antibody recognition and score the expected antigenic effect of combinations of mutations. These scores correlate with neutralization assays performed on SARS-CoV-2 variants and emphasize the ominous antigenic properties of the recently described Omicron variant. An interactive version of the estimator is at https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2\_RBD\_Ab\_escape\_maps/escape-calc/ (last accessed 11 March 2022), and we provide a Python module for batch processing. Currently the calculator uses primarily data for antibodies elicited by Wuhan-Hu-1-like vaccination or infection and so is expected to work best for calculating escape from such immunity for mutations relative to early SARS-CoV-2 strains.}",
